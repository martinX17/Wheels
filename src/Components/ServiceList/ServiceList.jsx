            <p>A full motorcycle service will ensure any mechanical or electrical problems are ironed out ahead of your MOT and of course before they affect the safe operation of your motorbike. Regularly servicing your motorcycle will not only prolong its life; Your machine may also be more efficient and more pleasant to ride when all its components are in optimum condition.</p>
            <p className='mt-5 text-lg text-white font-bold'>What does a motorcycle service include?</p>
            <p>What constitutes a full service when it comes to motorcycle servicing can vary a little from garage to garage, but in general a full motorcycle service should pinpoint and address any issues that may affect the safe operation of your machine.</p>
            <p className='mt-5 text-lg text-white font-bold'>How long does it take to service a bike?</p>
            <p>A motorbike service can take anywhere between 45 minutes to a day, depending on the issues discovered during the service. Generally, you would be looking at an average of around 2 hours for a motorbike service. Remember to factor in that the point at which the garage will start work on your motorbike will depend on how many other jobs that they have booked in for that day. Itâ€™s best to find out when the garage think that your motorbike may be ready by.</p>
